# Time-Series-LSTM-based-Solar-Energy-Prediciton


LSTM has been widely used for predicting the sequential/time series data. This project presents the Time series-based prediction of the solar power output on daily basis using LSTMs. Raw weather data files from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration and the power production data files from Urbana-Champaign solar farm has been taken from [1]
